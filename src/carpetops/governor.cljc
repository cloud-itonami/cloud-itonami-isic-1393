  "Carpet & Rug Plant Operations Governor -- the independent compliance
  layer that earns the CarpetAdvisor the right to commit. The advisor
  has no notion of whether a piece of equipment it wants to schedule
  maintenance against has actually been inspected/registered, whether
  a batch it wants to coordinate a shipment against has actually been
  QC-verified/registered, whether a maintenance proposal secretly
  tries to DIRECTLY OPERATE (rather than merely draft-schedule) a
  tufting machine, weaving loom, or backing line, whether a shipment
  proposal's own claimed area would blow through the batch's own
  logged production area, or when an act stops being a coordination
  proposal and becomes direct tufting/weaving/backing-line-equipment
  control, so this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a
  proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:carpet-rug-plant-operations-governor` (see
  docs/adr/0001-architecture.md).

  Checks below, ALL HARD violations except the confidence/high-stakes

                                       evaluated BEFORE anything else.
    2. Closed op allowlist         -- is `:op` one of the four ops this
                                       actor is authorized to coordinate?
                                       Anything else -- HARD hold.
    3. Closed effect allowlist     -- is the PROPOSAL's own `:effect`
                                       (what would actually commit) one

                                       two independent layers agree).

                                       refuses to schedule the SAME

                                       as much a ground-truth fact as
                                       an equipment unit's own.
